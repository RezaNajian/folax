# FOL: Efficient Solution and Optimization of PDEs
Finite Operator Learning (FOL) combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and numerical methods to solve partial differential equations without data, providing accurate sensitivities and enabling efficient gradient-based optimization. It uses a feed-forward neural network to map the design space to the solution space while ensuring compliance with physical laws.
