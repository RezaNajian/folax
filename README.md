# FOL: Efficient Solution and Optimization of PDEs
Finite Operator Learning (FOL) combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and classical numerical methods to solve and optimize parametrically defined partial differential equations (PDEs). In essence, FOL directly utilizes the discretized residuals of governing equations during the backpropagation step of training, enabling the integration of traditional numerical methodsâ€”such as finite element methods (FEM). The advantages of this approach are thoroughly studied and detailed in FOL's publication.

# Main Features
- Python-based framework built on [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), leveraging key features like auto-vectorization with [jax.vmap()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap), just-in-time compilation with [jax.jit()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit), and automatic differentiation with [jax.grad()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad) for high-efficiency computations on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. This framework integrates seamlessly with [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax?tab=readme-ov-file) for building modular and flexible neural networks, [Optax](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax) for applying state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization algorithms, and [Orbax](https://github.com/google/orbax) for efficient checkpointing and serialization, ensuring scalability and ease of use in large-scale training processes.
- Easily implement the weak form of desired PDEs in Python; the framework handles the rest for highly efficient neural operator learning, PINNs, and finite element simulations.
- FOL utilizes the [mesh_io](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) library for seamless mesh and result file handling, and [PETSc4py](https://petsc.org/release/) for efficiently solving large-scale linear systems.
